# Python is an object-orientated language,
# and as such it uses classes to define data types, including its primitive types.
# Casting in python is therefore done using constructor functions:
# int() - constructs an integer number from an integer literal,
# a float literal (by removing all decimals), or a string literal (providing the string represents a whole number)

# float() - constructs a float number from an integer literal,
# a float literal or a string literal (providing the string represents a float or an integer)

# str() - constructs a string from a wide variety of data types, including strings, integer literals and float literals

# Integers:
x = int(1)
print(x)

y = int(2.8)
print(y)

z = int("3")
print(z)

# Floats:
x = float(1)
print(x)

y = float(2.8)
print(y)

z = float("3")
print(z)

w = float("4.2")
print(w)

# Strings:
x = str("s1")
print(x)

y = str(2)
print(y)

z = str(3.0)
print(z)

print(int(35.88))
